# Resume

*This resume is automatically generated from LinkedIn profile data and updated weekly.*

**Status**: Waiting for first LinkedIn data scrape. The resume will appear here after the first successful run of the GitHub Actions workflow.

## How it works

1. GitHub Actions runs weekly to scrape LinkedIn profile data
2. The scraped data is converted to a formatted markdown resume
3. The resume is automatically committed and deployed via GitHub Pages

To view the generated resume, ensure that:
- GitHub Secrets are properly configured
- GitHub Pages is enabled for this repository
- The GitHub Actions workflow has run successfully
