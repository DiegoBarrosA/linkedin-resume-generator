# LinkedIn Resume Generator - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented all fixes to remove hardcoding from the generated resume and improve data accuracy as requested in the original plan (`fix-linkedin-scraping.plan.md`).

## Changes Implemented

### ✅ 1. Navigate to Detailed Section Pages
- **File**: `src/linkedin_resume_generator/scrapers/linkedin_scraper.py`
- Added `_navigate_to_details_section()` method to visit:
  - `/details/experience` - for complete experience data
  - `/details/skills` - for all skills with endorsements
- Updated `_extract_experience()` to navigate to experience details page
- Updated `skill_extractor.py` to navigate to skills details page

### ✅ 2. Handle Multiple Positions at Same Company
- **File**: `src/linkedin_resume_generator/scrapers/linkedin_scraper.py`
- Completely rewrote experience extraction with targeted CSS selectors
- Improved company name extraction to filter out "Freelance" and other employment types
- Handles both single positions and grouped positions by company

### ✅ 3. Parse Date Ranges Properly
- **File**: `src/linkedin_resume_generator/scrapers/linkedin_scraper.py`
- Added `_parse_date_range()` method to split duration strings
- Handles formats: "Jan 2020 - Present", "2020 - 2024", "Month Year"
- Populates both `start_date` and `end_date` fields

### ✅ 4. Improve Skills Extraction
- **File**: `src/linkedin_resume_generator/scrapers/skill_extractor.py`
- Updated to navigate to `/details/skills` page
- Extracts endorsement counts
- Handles "Show more" button expansion
- Added fallback to main page if navigation fails

### ✅ 5. Update Resume Generator to Use Grouped Positions
- **File**: `src/linkedin_resume_generator/generators/resume_generator.py`
- Modified `_create_markdown_content()` to group experience by company
- Shows company name as main heading
- Lists each position as sub-item with date range
- Uses `start_date` and `end_date` for date ranges

### ✅ 6. Authentication Improvements
- **File**: `src/linkedin_resume_generator/scrapers/authentication.py`
- Implemented exact LinkedIn login flow from Selenium recording
- Click "try-another-way" link to switch to TOTP
- Handle device recognition checkbox
- Use correct TOTP selectors: `#input__phone_verification_pin`
- Submit with `#two-step-submit-button`
- Increased timeouts from 5s to 15s for slow CI environments
- Character-by-character typing for reliable input entry

### ✅ 7. Profile Navigation After Authentication
- **File**: `src/linkedin_resume_generator/scrapers/linkedin_scraper.py`
- Handle LinkedIn authwall by extracting sessionRedirect
- Decode redirect URL properly
- Wait 5 seconds for authwall to clear
- Fallback navigation if authwall persists
- Better handling of challenge/redirect pages

### ✅ 8. Settings Configuration
- **File**: `src/linkedin_resume_generator/config/settings.py`
- Added `extra='ignore'` to Settings model_config
- Load `.env` file explicitly using `python-dotenv`
- Proper handling of legacy `LINKEDIN_*` environment variables
- Add `LINKEDIN_HEADLESS` environment variable support

### ✅ 9. Error Handling and Logging
- Added extensive debug logging throughout scraping process
- Log which selectors are attempted and which succeed
- Log number of items found at each step
- Better error messages showing what was found
- Log page content when selectors fail

## Technical Details

### Key Selectors Updated
- Company: `.t-14.t-normal.t-black span`, `.pv-entity__secondary-title`
- Title: `.mr1.hoverable-link-text.t-bold span`, `h3.t-bold span`
- Dates: `.pvs-entity__caption-wrapper`, `.t-14.t-normal.t-black--light`
- TOTP Input: `#input__phone_verification_pin` (from Selenium recording)
- Submit Button: `#two-step-submit-button` (from Selenium recording)

### Date Parsing Logic
```python
async def _parse_date_range(self, date_text: str) -> tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str]]:
    """Parse 'Jan 2020 - Present' into (start_date, end_date)"""
```

### Grouping Logic
- Uses `defaultdict(list)` to group experiences by company
- If multiple positions: show company heading with position sub-items
- If single position: show "Title at Company" format
