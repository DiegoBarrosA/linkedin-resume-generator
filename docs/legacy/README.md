## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- LinkedIn account with email/password login
- Basic knowledge of GitHub repositories and settings

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Setup

1. **Fork or clone** this repository to your GitHub account
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)`
   - Save the settings

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets in your repository settings (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

#### Required Secrets:
- `LINKEDIN_EMAIL`: Your LinkedIn login email
- `LINKEDIN_PASSWORD`: Your LinkedIn login password

#### Optional Secrets:
- `LINKEDIN_TOTP_SECRET`: Your TOTP secret key (if you use 2FA)

#### How to add secrets:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add each secret with the exact name shown above

### 3. TOTP Setup (If using 2FA)

If your LinkedIn account uses 2FA with an authenticator app:

1. **Get your TOTP secret**:
   - Go to LinkedIn Security settings
   - When setting up 2FA, LinkedIn will show a QR code
   - Look for the manual entry option to get the secret key
   - Or scan the QR code with a TOTP app and export the secret

2. **Add the secret**:
   - Add the secret key as `LINKEDIN_TOTP_SECRET` in GitHub Secrets
   - The secret should be a base32-encoded string (usually 16-32 characters)

### 4. Test the Workflow

1. **Manual run**:
   - Go to Actions tab in your repository
   - Select "Update LinkedIn Resume" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"

2. **Check the results**:
   - Monitor the workflow execution
   - Check if files are generated and committed
   - Visit your GitHub Pages URL (usually `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**:
   - Verify GitHub Secrets are set correctly
   - Check if LinkedIn requires additional verification
   - Try running the workflow manually for debugging

2. **Scraping Errors**:
   - LinkedIn may have changed their HTML structure
   - Check workflow logs for specific error messages
   - Update selectors in `scrape_linkedin.py` if needed

3. **GitHub Pages Not Updating**:
   - Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled
   - Check that files are being committed
   - Verify the `index.md` file is generated

4. **TOTP Issues**:
   - Verify the TOTP secret is correct
   - Check that the time on GitHub Actions matches your TOTP app
   - Try regenerating TOTP secret in LinkedIn

### Debugging

Enable debug mode by setting `headless=False` in `scrape_linkedin.py`:
```python
browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
```
